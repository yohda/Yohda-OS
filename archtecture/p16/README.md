For real mode in Yohda OS, there are two modes.

1" For Debugging on read mode, you can do debuggig with GDB. 
In the case, you have to pass the argument `D=1` to makefile.
e.g `make D=1`. you can change the value `D` to anything what you want.

2" For protected mode, you just should use only `make` command.
